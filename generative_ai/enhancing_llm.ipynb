Armstrong and Aldrin had been on the backup\\ncrew for Apollo 8; the third member of that crew, Fred W. Haise, was replaced\\nby Collins on the flight crew because Deke Slayton wanted an experienced pilot\\nin the command module for Apollo 11, which, ifallwent well, would most likely\\nbe the first mission to attempt a lunar landing. 7\\nThe success of Apollo 8 leftonly the qualification of the lunar module to be accom-\\nplished before a lunar landing could be attempted. In the alphabetical sequence\\nof missions adopted a year before (see Chapter 7), the next mission (\"D\") was\\nto fly both the command/service module and the lunar module, to check out all\\nLM systems and rendezvous techniques in earth orbit.
